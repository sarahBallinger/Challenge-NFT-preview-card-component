# Challenge-NFT-preview-card-component
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) NFT preview card component HTML &amp; CSS challenge

# Description:

This challenge required a basic understanding of HTML & CSS. The goal was to recrate an NFT card using JPG images of the design files for reference.

# What I Learned:

**I discovered & learned how to use width: min();**

Full transparency, I deleted the full css file after completing the challenge, because it was atrociously responsive. So I started over. I was researching how to fix the issue and came across width: min();. Incorporating this into the project fixed the responsivness and I found this function extremly handy. 

**I learned another how to really use align-items in flexbox**

I thought that align-items: center; would align the items in the center of the div (meaning centered on the main axis and cross axis). so I spent alot of time trying to adjust the padding-bottom on the areas where I had text next to an icon, so that they would appear on the same line... finally after playing with align-items on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), I realized how easy it really was to accomplish this.
